Specify the format for dates in the game.

[h1]Detailed Description[/h1]
The following date formatting items can be specified:[list]
[*]Date part order can be DMY, MDY, or YMD.
[*]Date part separator can be slash (/), period (.), dash (-), or space.
[*]Month and day can be with or without a leading zero for values less than 10.[/list]

Game dates will often be year 2100 or later, therefore the year is always formatted with 4 digits.

Click Reset To Default to reset all settings to their default values.  The default values correspond to the normal date format used by the game which is DMY, slash, with leading zeroes.

The date format can be changed while a game is in progress.  The new date format will be applied immediately.

The following dates are formatted:[list]
[*]Main game date
[*]ChirpX Launch Site - past launch dates
[*]Festival Area - concert dates
[*]Football Stadium - next and past match dates
[*]Varsity Sports Arenas - next and past match dates[/list]
